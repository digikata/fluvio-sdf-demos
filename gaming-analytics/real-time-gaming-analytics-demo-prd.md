# Real Time Gaming Analytics Demo

**Goal**: Demonstrate real-time data ingestion, processing, transformation, and visualization for analytics in gaming, using Fluvio, SDF, and visualization tools.

**Audience**: Architects and technology leaders in gaming

## 1. **Use Cases**

### 1.1 Real-Time Player Monitoring and Engagement Insights
   - **Use Case**: Track active player counts, analyze engagement patterns across levels/maps, and monitor player retention and movement to identify bugs or bottlenecks.
   - **Value**: Provides actionable insights to improve player retention, identify gameplay friction points, and prioritize bug fixes.

### 1.2 In-Game Economy, Purchase Analytics, and Fraud Detection
   - **Use Case**: Analyze player purchasing behavior in real-time, tracking trends in virtual item popularity, purchase frequency, and potential fraudulent activities.
   - **Fraud Detection**: Implement basic rules for flagging suspicious purchase behavior (e.g., unusually high purchase frequency from a single account or IP).
   - **Value**: Enables monetization strategies, insights into virtual economy dynamics, and detection of potentially fraudulent activity.

### 1.3 Operational Analytics for Server Health and Player Experience
   - **Use Case**: Monitor server health and player experience metrics, such as latency and disconnection rates, to ensure high-quality gameplay.
   - **Value**: Helps quickly identify and resolve performance issues, maintaining smooth gameplay.

## 2. **Data Flows**

### 2.1 Synthetic Data Generation and API Integration
   - **Step 1**: Synthetic data generator simulates game events (e.g., player movements, purchases, server logs) and publishes these events to Fluvio topics via the Fluvio client.
   - **Step 1A**: The synthetic data generator wrapped in a web API to stream data through Fluvioâ€™s HTTP connector, demonstrating an alternative ingestion method.

### 2.2 Real-Time Data Processing in SDF
   - **Step 3**: SDF processes the data in Fluvio topics. This includes:
     - **Data Enrichment**: Add metadata (e.g., player tags, server IDs, map details) to events for enriched context.
     - **Transformation**: Standardize data formats, aggregates specific metrics (e.g., active players, purchase trends) for efficient real-time analysis.
     - **Engagement and Retention Tracking**: Track player retention, engagement, and activity on different levels or maps to identify possible bugs or areas where players tend to get stuck.
     - **Fraud Detection for Purchases**: Add basic fraud detection by flagging suspicious purchase patterns, such as repeated purchases within short time intervals.
     - **Aggregation**: Aggregate data points for cumulative metrics such as player retention by level, total purchases by item type, and average server response times.

### 2.3 Data Visualization and Dashboard Integration
   - **Step 4**: Route processed data to:
     - **Apache Echarts**: Displays real-time visualizations (e.g., player counts, popular in-game items, engagement metrics).
     - **Grafana via Graphite Connector**: Integrates aggregated metrics into Grafana dashboards for operational monitoring, enabling DevOps teams to visualize server health, latency trends, and flagged fraud instances.

## 3. **Sample Data Inputs and Expected Outputs**

### 3.1 Sample Data Inputs

#### Player Engagement and Retention Data
   - **Fields**: `player_id`, `session_id`, `event_type` (e.g., move, interaction), `level_id`, `map_id`, `timestamp`
   - **Example**:
     ```json
     {
       "player_id": "12345",
       "session_id": "abcd1234",
       "event_type": "move",
       "level_id": "level_01",
       "map_id": "map_05",
       "timestamp": "2024-11-12T10:00:00Z"
     }
     ```

#### Purchase Data with Fraud Detection
   - **Fields**: `player_id`, `item_id`, `price`, `currency`, `purchase_timestamp`, `ip_address`
   - **Example**:
     ```json
     {
       "player_id": "12345",
       "item_id": "skin_dragon",
       "price": 4.99,
       "currency": "USD",
       "purchase_timestamp": "2024-11-12T10:05:00Z",
       "ip_address": "192.168.0.1"
     }
     ```

#### Server Health Data
   - **Fields**: `server_id`, `cpu_load`, `memory_usage`, `latency`, `timestamp`
   - **Example**:
     ```json
     {
       "server_id": "server_1",
       "cpu_load": 65,
       "memory_usage": 80,
       "latency": 120,
       "timestamp": "2024-11-12T10:10:00Z"
     }
     ```

### 3.2 Expected Outputs

#### Player Engagement and Retention Insights
   - **Output**: Aggregated metrics like active player count per level/map and average session duration, suitable for display in Echarts and Grafana.
   - **Example**:
     ```json
     {
       "level_id": "level_01",
       "map_id": "map_05",
       "active_players": 350,
       "average_session_duration": 35.2
     }
     ```
