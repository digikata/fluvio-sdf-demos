# Gaming Analytics DataFlow

The gaming analytics demo includes the following use cases:

**Player Engagement:** Tracking active players and monitoring engagement across levels and maps to identify where players may get stuck or disengage.

**Purchase Behavior & Fraud Detection:** Real-time analytics on in-game purchases to understand item popularity and flag potential fraud.

**Server Health:** Monitoring server performance to maintain high-quality gameplay.

## Event Generation

The `data-generator` directory contains two forms of data generation capability: 
- An event generator script using the Fluvio Python client to generate events and produce them to topics.
- A web API wrapper that produces the same data, collected via the HTTP source connector.

### Player Event
This event captures player actions within a game, such as movement, interactions, or level completion, and is sent to the `player-events` topic.

**Schema:**
- **event_name**: Descriptive name for the player action (e.g., `player_action`).
- **parameters**:
  - **player_id**: Unique identifier for the player.
  - **session_id**: Unique identifier for the player's session.
  - **event_type**: Type of event (e.g., `move`, `interaction`, `level_complete`).
  - **level_id**: The game level where the event occurred.
  - **map_id**: The specific map within the level.
- **event_timestamp**: ISO timestamp of the event.
- **user_data**:
  - **user_id**: Consistent player identifier.
  - **platform**: Player’s platform (e.g., `PC`, `Console`).

**Example:**
```json
{
  "event_name": "player_action",
  "parameters": {
    "player_id": "player_123",
    "session_id": "session_456",
    "event_type": "move",
    "level_id": "level_02",
    "map_id": "map_03"
  },
  "event_timestamp": "2024-11-12T10:15:30Z",
  "user_data": {
    "user_id": "player_123",
    "platform": "PC"
  }
}
```

### Purchase (Transaction) Event
This event represents an in-game purchase, which may be subject to fraud analysis, and is sent to the `purchase-events` topic.

**Schema:**
- **event_name**: Standardized name for transaction events (e.g., `transaction`).
- **parameters**:
  - **transaction_id**: Unique identifier for the transaction.
  - **transaction_type**: Type of transaction (e.g., `purchase`, `refund`).
  - **currency**: Currency in which the purchase was made.
  - **amount**: Cost of the item.
  - **item_id**: Identifier of the purchased item (e.g., in-game skin or weapon).
  - **item_type**: Item category (e.g., `skin`, `weapon`).
- **event_timestamp**: ISO timestamp of the purchase.
- **user_data**:
  - **user_id**: Player identifier.
  - **platform**: Player’s platform (e.g., `PC`, `Console`).

**Example:**
```json
{
  "event_name": "transaction",
  "parameters": {
    "transaction_id": "trans_789",
    "transaction_type": "purchase",
    "currency": "USD",
    "amount": 4.99,
    "item_id": "skin_dragon",
    "item_type": "skin"
  },
  "event_timestamp": "2024-11-12T10:16:05Z",
  "user_data": {
    "user_id": "player_123",
    "platform": "PC"
  }
}
```

### Server Metric Event
This event provides server metrics, such as CPU load, memory usage, and latency, essential for monitoring server health, and is sent to the `server-metrics` topic.

**Schema:**
- **event_name**: Name for server metric events (e.g., `server_metric`).
- **parameters**:
  - **server_id**: Unique identifier for the server.
  - **cpu_load**: Current CPU usage as a percentage.
  - **memory_usage**: Current memory usage as a percentage.
  - **latency**: Current network latency in milliseconds.
- **event_timestamp**: ISO timestamp of the server metrics capture.
- **server_data**:
  - **region**: Location or region of the server (e.g., `us-west`).
  - **server_type**: Type of server (e.g., `dedicated`, `virtual`).

**Example:**
```json
{
  "event_name": "server_metric",
  "parameters": {
    "server_id": "server_1",
    "cpu_load": 78,
    "memory_usage": 65,
    "latency": 120
  },
  "event_timestamp": "2024-11-12T10:16:30Z",
  "server_data": {
    "region": "us-west",
    "server_type": "dedicated"
  }
}
```

## Step-by-Step Fluvio Client

### Prerequisites
Ensure Fluvio is installed and running. You can follow the [Fluvio Quickstart Guide](https://www.fluvio.io/docs/getting-started/).

### Create Topics
Create the necessary Fluvio topics: `player-events`, `purchase-events`, and `server-metrics` by running the following commands:

```bash
fluvio topic create player-events
fluvio topic create purchase-events
fluvio topic create server-metrics
```

### Running the Data Generator

1. **Navigate to the `data-generator/fluvio-client` Directory:**

   ```bash
   cd path/to/gaming-analytics/data-generator/fluvio-client
   ```

2. **Set Up a Virtual Environment (Optional but recommended):**

   ```bash
   python3 -m venv gaming-analytics
   source venv/bin/activate
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies:**

   Install the Fluvio client library from `requirements.txt`:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Run the Data Generator:**

   Start the data generator by running `main.py`, which will begin producing events to the specified Fluvio topics:

   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

   This script will:
   - Generate synthetic data for **player events**, **purchase events**, and **server metric events**.
   - Publish each event to its corresponding Fluvio topic (`player-events`, `purchase-events`, and `server-metrics`).
   - Print each event to the console as it is produced.

5. **Verify Data in Fluvio Topics:**

   Use the following commands to verify that data is being produced to each topic:

   ```bash
   fluvio consume player-events -B
   fluvio consume purchase-events -B
   fluvio consume server-metrics -B
   ```

   The `-B` flag consumes all messages in the topic from the beginning, allowing you to see the events produced by `main.py`.

### Stopping the Data Generator
To stop the data generator, simply press `Ctrl+C` in the terminal where `main.py` is running.

## Step-by-Step HTTP API

**Run the API**
Start the API server with Uvicorn:

```bash
Copy code
uvicorn main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000
```
The server will now listen on http://localhost:8000 (or the specified host and port). You can access each event generator by navigating to the endpoints:

Player Event: http://localhost:8000/player_event
Purchase Event: http://localhost:8000/purchase_event
Server Metric: http://localhost:8000/server_metric

EVents are streamed in real-time here: http http://localhost:8000/stream_events

### Connecting with Fluvio HTTP Connector
Connecting with Fluvio HTTP Connector
To integrate this API with Fluvio, configure the Fluvio HTTP connector to point to these endpoints. The connector will then fetch events as needed, enabling real-time ingestion of the generated data.
